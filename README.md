# README

This tool is made for bringing together hosts and refugees for accommodation. It is used on-side by volunteers at LAF, the arrival center for refugees. Verification is done in a two-factor system via German ID/ (other) passport and a code sent via SMS to a valid mobile number. The German ID/passport is presented on-side in person by the hosts so volunteers can verify the people personally. Refugees are being picked up by the hosts personally.

The aim of this tool is to specifically  

1. provide safe space in these times of needs (verification system)  
2. support on-the-spot-matching for refugees arriving at LAF with hosts offering space  
3. better data security through this tool specifically built for the needs at LAF(GDPR-conform)
